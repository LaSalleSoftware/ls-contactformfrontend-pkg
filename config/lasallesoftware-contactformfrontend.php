    | The View Files Are Located In Which Package?
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The controllers display view files.
    | 
    | Instead of using a hard coded "lasallesoftwarecontactformfrontend" (this package),
    | which means you have to publish the view (blade) files (to your public folder)
    | and then edit them directly -- which you can do if you want -- I want the 
    | ability to do custom contact form views in a custom UI package. 
    | 
    | So I created this config parameter. 
    | 
    | It is critical that you append your view's package name with "::"!

    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This content form package's view files extend a base layout. 
    |  
    | The command in the blade files is:
    | @extends('lasallesoftwarelasalleui::base.layouts.baselayout')
    | 
    | Instead of hard coding the location of this base layout, I created this
    | config parameter so we can use our own base layout with the views provided
    | in the package. 
    |
    | So, we can use the views in my content form package with our own layout. 
    | 
    | It is critical that you use the full "path". That is, the package name 
    | and the path to the layout using dot notation.
